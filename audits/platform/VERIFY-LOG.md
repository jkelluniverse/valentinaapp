## Tenant #1
- ✓ tenant row exists (slug valentina)
- ✓ fixed id matches the DAL constant — tnt_valentina_000000001
- ✓ journey-v1 + warm-clay
- ✓ her three panels as generic module keys — archetypal-keys, body-graph, values-spiral
- ✓ her branded names live in settings, not code — Human Design · Gene Keys · Values spiral

## Backfill (all tables)
- ✓ every row in every scoped table carries her tenantId — 66 tables checked

## Cross-tenant isolation — all 66 tables
- ✓ tenant B sees zero rows in every table (her data invisible)
- ✓ every table's B row is visible to B
- ✓ her tenant sees none of B's rows in any table
- ✓ legacy null rows belong to the DEFAULT tenant only (5 table probe)

## Host resolution
- ✓ custom domain resolves the default tenant (no PLATFORM_DOMAIN set)
- ✓ subdomain resolves its slug
- ✓ apex resolves the default tenant
- ✓ foreign host resolves the default tenant
- ✓ nested subdomain never leaks a slug

ALL CHECKS PASS
