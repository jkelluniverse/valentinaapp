## Built & verified: (list as completed)
Seeded 2026-09-05 from the repo's verify logs (audits/*/VERIFY-LOG.md) so the
PM starts with the true ledger, not an empty one.

  16-screen visual baseline · GET/write smokes · tenant-stamp audit · platform isolation verify

## Blocked / awaiting Architect:
- (Jacob/counsel) v3.0 sections for the v3.1 master; Spanish legal translation; Ch. 490 blessing;
  PRACTICE_EMAIL env; Addendum P election default; Addendum R retention confirmation; then flip
  `client-services-agreement` DRAFT→ACTIVE (deliberate DB act, excluded from upload-confirm path)
- (Architect) C19 continuation spec — pipeline Phase 3+ / Pocket capture layer (adapter seam ready)
- (Jacob go-ahead, no spec needed) C22 phase 2 — uploaded-PDF render-and-fill (pdf.js + pdf-lib,
  drag-drop field placement, coordinate stamping)
- (Jacob acceptance) PLATFORM Phase 6 canvas-v1 — spec held; gated on acceptance of Phases 0–5
- (code, anytime) task #75 — auto-stamp nested relation writes with tenantId (nightly audit is the net)
- (Jacob decision) Cloudflare R2 storage cutover (local driver live; config swap)

## Standing laws: specs are law; verbatim legal text; evidence-mandatory AI; no invented features;
   kill-switches & gates per spec; report discrepancies, never silently resolve them.
Additional standing decisions already in force (from prior builds):
- Drawn signature REQUIRED to sign (Jacob, 2026-08-12) — UI + server enforced
- E-records disclosure wording approved as written (Jacob, 2026-08-12)
- No PAN/CVV/bank-account capture anywhere — instruments live in Square (PCI)
- Client-visible chrome changes require explicit acceptance; 16-screen byte baseline enforces it
- Every raw-prisma access is allowlisted with justification (scripts/guard-prisma.ts, prebuild gate)
